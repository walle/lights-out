# Lights Out

Simple game to try out Electron (http://electron.atom.io/).

Turn off all the lights to win. If one square is clicked it's inverted,
together with all adjacent (up, right, down, left) squares.

## Installation

The app is only built for OSX and can be downloaded from github releases
(url). Unzip the .zip file and start the Lights Out.app application. Drag it
to Application to install.

### Run from source

If you don't want to install it on OSX or if you are running another operating
system you can test it out by running it from source. Clone the repository and
cd into it. Run `$ npm install` to install dependencies then `$ npm start` to
run the app. This requires you to have `npm` installed.
